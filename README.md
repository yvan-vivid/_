# Yvan Vivid's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.

## How do I use?

These are meant to be used with a tool called *dotzo* that I have made elsewhere. *dotzo* will be included eventually in this repo under the `bin` directory with the other utilities.

Otherwise, things can be pulled *a la carte*.

This is still a bit of a WIP.
